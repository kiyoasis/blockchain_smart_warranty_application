# Blockchain-based Decentralized Smart Warranty Application 

## Project overview

In this project, the smart contracts and DApp of decentralized smart warranty application has been created for energy storage supply chain and its warranty management.
The smart contract is to be deployed on the public testnet Rinkeby. 
The blockchain identity to secure digital assets is managed on the Ethereum platform using a smart contract using Solidity.

## Deploy smart contract on Public Test Network (Rinkeby)

```
truffle migrate --reset --compile-all â€”-network rinkeby
```

Using network 'rinkeby'.
